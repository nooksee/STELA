## TRUTH.md
# TRUTH.md

## 1. Filing Doctrine
Filing:
- `ops/` = Run (binaries, manifests, automation).
- `docs/` = Explain (manuals and rationale).
- `projects/` = Work (payload code).
- `storage/` = Trash (local artifacts, never canon).

## 2. Axioms (Constitution)
- Precedence: TRUTH is final authority; if conflict exists, stop and ask.
- SSOT: one canonical file per domain; other mentions are pointers.
- Reuse-first: search ops/ for an existing template before creating a new artifact.
- Context Hazard: any inclusion of `docs/library/agents`, `docs/library/tasks`, or `docs/library/skills` in the global context manifest is a failure.
- Drift: any divergence between canon and repository state, or duplication of canon outside SSOT, is a failure state that requires stop and correction.
- SoP: history ledger only; no permanent rules live there.

## 3. Canon Surfaces
- `TRUTH.md` - constitution and invariants.
- `TASK.md` - active work surface and DP contract.
- `SoP.md` - history ledger and shipment record.
- `AGENTS.md` - staffing protocol and behavioral logic.
- `docs/library/MANUAL.md` - operator mechanics.
- `docs/library/MAP.md` - context wayfinding.
- `ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md` - required context set.
- `llms.txt` - discovery entry point.


## SoP.md
Archive policy: keep most recent 30 entries; older entries moved to `storage/archives/root/SoP-archive-YYYY-MM.md`.

## 2026-02-05 - DP-OPS-0024: Phase 3 Security Hardening & Autopoietic Compliance

- Purpose: Enforce Phase 3 input sanitization, style enforcement, and project STELA validation to close audit gaps.
- What shipped:
  - Hardened `ops/lib/scripts/project.sh` with strict token validation and realpath-based path validation for agent and registry access.
  - Updated `tools/lint/style.sh` to fail on contraction tokens across `docs/` and `ops/` and require `rg`.
  - Added `tools/lint/project.sh` to validate project STELA references against `docs/library/INDEX.md`.
  - Updated `docs/library/MAP.md` to define Provider and Consumer root ontology.
  - Removed contraction tokens from `ops/bin/open`, `docs/CONTEXT.md`, and agent guidance surfaces.
- Verification:
  - `./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform`
  - `bash tools/lint/context.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/truth.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/project.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/style.sh`
  - `bash ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh harvest --name "DP-OPS-0024 Worker Closeout" --context "platform maintenance closeout for DP-OPS-0024" --solution "No promotion. This run records security hardening, lint additions, and receipt proofs." --force`
  - `bash ops/bin/prune`
  - `bash ops/bin/llms`
- Risk / rollback:
  - Risk: Medium (project inputs now reject non-token display names and notes; style lint now blocks contractions in `docs/` and `ops/`).
  - Rollback: revert `ops/lib/scripts/project.sh`, `tools/lint/style.sh`, `tools/lint/project.sh`, `docs/library/MAP.md`, `ops/bin/open`, `docs/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/library/agents/R-AGENT-03.md`, `docs/library/agents/R-AGENT-05.md`, `docs/library/agents/R-AGENT-06.md`, and `SoP.md`.

## 2026-02-05 - DP-OPS-0023: Phase 3 Activation (Project Binary Alignment & Linter Refactor)

- Purpose: Restore `ops/bin/project work` after static `open` reversal by moving project and agent context injection into the project binary, then harden lint tools for root-safe execution.
- What shipped:
  - Refactored `ops/bin/project` `cmd_work` to call `ops/bin/open` without deprecated flags, capture OPEN output to `storage/handoff/`, append project STELA/README context, and inject agent role text resolved via `project_resolve_agent_file` and `project_extract_agent_role`.
  - Hardened `tools/lint/context.sh`, `tools/lint/truth.sh`, `tools/lint/library.sh`, and `tools/verify.sh` to resolve `REPO_ROOT` via git and force `cd "$REPO_ROOT" || exit 1` before file operations.
  - Updated `tools/lint/truth.sh` file selection to filter missing tracked paths before grep so unstaged deletions do not produce scan noise.
  - Verified Skills pointer surfaces were already aligned to `docs/library/SKILLS.md` in `ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh`, `llms.txt`, and `docs/library/INDEX.md`; no path edits were required in this slice.
- Verification:
  - `./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform`
  - `bash tools/lint/context.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/truth.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/library.sh`
  - `bash tools/verify.sh`
  - `bash ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh harvest --name "DP-OPS-0023 Worker Closeout" --context "platform maintenance closeout for DP-OPS-0023" --solution "No promotion. This run records project binary alignment, linter hardening, and receipt proofs." --force`
  - `bash ops/bin/prune`
  - `bash ops/bin/llms --out-dir=storage/handoff`
- Risk / rollback:
  - Risk: Medium (project work prompt generation path changed from direct open flags to captured artifact assembly).
  - Rollback: revert `ops/bin/project`, `tools/lint/context.sh`, `tools/lint/truth.sh`, `tools/lint/library.sh`, `tools/verify.sh`, and `SoP.md`.

## 2026-02-05 - DP-OPS-0022: Factory Consolidation, Linter Root Fix, and Open Reversal

- Purpose: Resolve linter path fragility, relocate the Skills registry to library canon, remove redundant integration documents, and move agent-resolution helpers from `ops/bin/open` into `ops/lib/scripts/project.sh`.
- What shipped:
  - Refactored `tools/lint/context.sh`, `tools/lint/truth.sh`, `tools/lint/library.sh`, and `tools/verify.sh` to resolve repo root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and fail fast outside git.
  - Updated `tools/lint/truth.sh` to `cd` into `REPO_ROOT` before running `git ls-files`.
  - Hardened `tools/lint/truth.sh` grep execution to suppress transient missing-file noise from unstaged deletes.
  - Relocated `docs/library/SKILLS.md` to `docs/library/SKILLS.md` and updated pointers in `ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh`, `llms.txt`, and `docs/library/INDEX.md`.
  - Expanded `docs/library/INDEX.md` with agent and task registry entries so restored Library Guard resolves registry drift cleanly.
  - Deleted redundant docs `ops/lib/project/user-STELA.md`, `ops/lib/project/INTEGRATION.md`, and `docs/library/INTEGRATION.md`.
  - Restored `ops/bin/open` to static behavior and transplanted helper logic into `ops/lib/scripts/project.sh` as `project_resolve_agent_file` and `project_extract_agent_role`.
- Verification:
  - `./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform`
  - `bash tools/lint/context.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/truth.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/library.sh`
  - `bash tools/verify.sh`
  - `bash ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh harvest --name "DP-OPS-0022 Worker Closeout" --context "platform maintenance closeout for DP-OPS-0022" --solution "No promotion. This run records receipts and path migrations only." --force`
  - `bash ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh check`
  - `Skill promotion: no new skill promoted (platform maintenance closeout; draft retained for receipt evidence).`
  - `bash ops/bin/prune`
  - `bash ops/bin/llms --out-dir=storage/handoff`
- Risk / rollback:
  - Risk: Medium (the project binary still passes `--agent` and `--include` to `ops/bin/open`; follow-up alignment is required in a separate scoped change because `ops/bin/project` is out of DP allowlist).
  - Rollback: revert `tools/lint/context.sh`, `tools/lint/truth.sh`, `tools/lint/library.sh`, `tools/verify.sh`, `docs/library/SKILLS.md`, `ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh`, `llms.txt`, `docs/library/INDEX.md`, `ops/lib/scripts/project.sh`, `ops/bin/open`, deleted integration docs, and `SoP.md`.

## 2026-02-04 - DP-OPS-0021: Project Binary Interface & Dynamic Context

- Purpose: Establish the Project Binary interface and dynamic context bundles for Phase 3 specialization.
- What shipped:
  - Refactored ops/bin/llms to read Small and Full bundles from the manifest and added profile slicing.
  - Added `--agent` and `--include` handling in ops/bin/open for persona and project context injection.
  - Implemented ops/bin/project with updated registry helpers and manifest.
  - Updated ops/lib/project/STELA.md and added [REMOVED].md; tightened AGENTS and CONTEXT headings.
- Verification:
  - `./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform`
  - `bash tools/lint/context.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/truth.sh`
  - `bash ops/bin/prune`
  - `./ops/bin/llms --out-dir=storage/handoff`
- Risk / rollback:
  - Risk: Low (tooling and templates only).
  - Rollback: revert `AGENTS.md`, `[REMOVED].md`, `ops/bin/llms`, `ops/bin/open`, `ops/bin/project`, `ops/lib/scripts/project.sh`, `ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md`, `ops/lib/manifests/PROJECTS.md`, `ops/lib/project/STELA.md`, and `SoP.md`.

## 2026-02-04 - DP-OPS-0020: Phase Two Doctrine (Truth, Hygiene, Style)

- Purpose: Compress canon, add pruning and bundling automation, and enforce uniform style.
- What shipped:
  - Refactored TRUTH.md and AGENTS.md into axiomatic, compressed canon.
  - Updated TASK.md headings to decimal format and added closeout checks for prune and llms.
  - Added ops/bin/prune for SoP sliding window archiving and handoff cleanup.
  - Added ops/bin/llms and generated llms-small.txt and llms-full.txt bundles.
  - Added markdownlint configuration and style and llms lint scripts.
  - Updated llms.txt and recorded governance changes.
- Verification:
  - `./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform`
  - `bash tools/lint/context.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/truth.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/style.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/llms.sh`
  - `bash ops/bin/prune`
- Risk / rollback:
  - Risk: Low (governance and automation updates only).
  - Rollback: revert `TRUTH.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TASK.md`, `SoP.md`, `llms.txt`, `.markdownlint.json`, `ops/bin/prune`, `ops/bin/llms`, `tools/lint/llms.sh`, `tools/lint/style.sh`, `llms-small.txt`, and `llms-full.txt`.


## 2026-02-04 — DP-OPS-0019: Context Hazard Guardrails

- Purpose: Strengthen context doctrine and guardrails to keep library directories out of the global manifest.
- What shipped:
  - Defined Context Hazard in TRUTH and marked library directories as JIT-only.
  - Added Context Hygiene directive in AGENTS to enforce hazard exclusion from the manifest.
  - Added negative constraints to docs/CONTEXT and hardened context to fail on library hazards.
  - Updated TASK work log and recorded governance update in SoP.
- Verification:
  - `./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform`
  - `bash tools/lint/context.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/truth.sh`
- Risk / rollback:
  - Risk: Low (governance and lint guard updates only).
  - Rollback: revert `TRUTH.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CONTEXT.md`, `tools/lint/context.sh`, and `SoP.md`.

## 2026-02-04 — DP-OPS-0018: Proposal Protocol and Drafting Friction Reduction

- Purpose: Reduce DP drafting deadlocks by allowing provisional branch and Base HEAD proposals while preserving worker git authority.
- What shipped:
  - Updated TASK template to allow Integrator-assigned or Integrator-proposed (Operator-created) work branch labeling and to allow Base HEAD to be `Not provided` or `Current (draft; lock at merge)` during drafting, with a drafting note on finalization and worker stop rules.
  - Added Drafting Proposal Protocol in AGENTS to permit Integrator proposals, require `PROPOSED:` prefixes during drafting, and reaffirm Operator-provided finalization and contractor branch limits.
  - Added zero-byte dump verification in TASK receipt and clarified Mandatory Closing Block checklist wording.
- Verification:
  - `bash tools/verify.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/context.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/truth.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/dp.sh --test`
  - `./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform --format=chatgpt --out=auto --bundle`
- Risk / rollback:
  - Risk: Low (governance text updates only).
  - Rollback: revert `TASK.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `SoP.md`.

## 2026-02-03 — DP-OPS-0016: Hardened TASK.md (context hygiene + mandatory closing block)

- Purpose: Harden TASK worker context boundaries, receipt discipline, and closeout metadata structure.
- What shipped:
  - Removed OPEN from worker context load instructions and added the Integrator-only OPEN rule plus disposable artifact prohibition.
  - Expanded receipt checklist to require OPEN, OPEN-PORCELAIN, and dump artifacts with explicit failure conditions.
  - Added the Mandatory Closing Block with six distinct commit and PR metadata fields.
- Verification:
  - `./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform`
  - `bash tools/lint/context.sh`
  - `bash tools/lint/truth.sh`
- Risk / rollback:
  - Risk: Low (governance text updates only).
  - Rollback: revert `TASK.md` and `SoP.md`.

## 2026-02-02 — DP-OPS-0015: Skills System Final Hardening and Consolidation

- Purpose: Consolidate S-LEARN-08 into S-LEARN-06 and harden S-LEARN-06 and S-LEARN-07 with Trap and Solution patterns plus concrete commands.
- What shipped:
  - Moved Advanced Git Forensics to S-LEARN-06 and removed S-LEARN-08.
  - Rewrote S-LEARN-06 and S-LEARN-07 with mandated Trap and Solution guidance and concrete command checks.

## TASK.md
# STELA TASK DASHBOARD (LIVING SURFACE)
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Owner (Integrator):** [Name/Handle]  
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

> This file is the **single living surface** for the current work thread:
> - **Top:** current Dispatch Packet (DP) intent + constraints
> - **Bottom:** Work Log (timestamped continuity breadcrumbs + single next action)

Canon surface definitions live in `TRUTH.md`.

---

## 1. Required Context Load (Pre-Flight)
**Rule:** No execution until the worker explicitly confirms these are loaded.

**Must read (always):**
- [ ] `TRUTH.md` (precedence + invariants)
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` (jurisdiction / stop-and-ask)
- [ ] `SoP.md` (merge-grade readiness ledger)
- [ ] `ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md` (required context set)
- [ ] `docs/library/MAP.md` (continuity terrain)

(OPEN is for Integrator/DP Writer state refresh; Worker does not read OPEN).
DISPOSABLE ARTIFACTS (chat logs, etc.) MUST NOT BE REFERENCED OR INCLUDED.

**Job-specific canon (fill in per DP):**
- [ ] [path/to/file]
- [ ] [path/to/file]

**Loading discipline (worker must echo):**
- “Loaded: TRUTH, AGENTS, SoP, CONTEXT, MAP (+ job-specific files).”

---

## 2. Active Context (Thread Header)
- **Goal:** System Consolidation & Truth Enforcement.
- **Constraint:** “My Local is Truth.”
- **Current DP:** DP-OPS-[ID] — [TITLE]
- **Work Branch (Integrator-assigned OR Integrator-proposed (Operator-created)):** [EXACT branch name]
- **Base HEAD (operator-provided):** [short-hash] or `Not provided` / `Current (draft; lock at merge)`
- **Single Next Action:** [One sentence. No lists.]
- **Blockers:** [None / describe]

**Drafting note:** Provisional Work Branch and Base HEAD values are allowed during drafting but must be finalized before worker execution. Workers still stop on any freshness mismatch and do not create or switch branches.

---

## 3. Current Dispatch Packet (DP) - Stela Standard (A-E)
**Formatting rule:** When emitted in chat, the entire DP must be enclosed in a single fenced code block (start to end).
# DP-OPS-[ID]: [TITLE]

## 3.1 Freshness Gate (Must Pass Before Work)
Base Branch: [branch]  
Required Work Branch: [branch]  
Base HEAD: [short-hash] (preferred) or `Not provided` / `Current (draft; lock at merge)`

Required local re-check (worker runs; paste results in RESULTS):
- `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
- `git rev-parse HEAD`
- `git status --porcelain`

Worker must already be on the **Required Work Branch** listed above (no branch creation or switching).

STOP if any mismatch.  
STOP if the Required Work Branch is missing.  
STOP if told to create or switch branches.

---

## 3.2 Required Context Load (Read Before Doing Anything)
**Worker must confirm loaded before acting:**
- TRUTH, AGENTS, SoP, CONTEXT, MAP
- Plus any DP-scoped files listed here:
  - [Exact path]
  - [Exact path]

(OPEN is for Integrator/DP Writer state refresh; Worker does not read OPEN).
DISPOSABLE ARTIFACTS (chat logs, etc.) MUST NOT BE REFERENCED OR INCLUDED.

---

## 3.3 Scope and Safety
- **Objective:** [One sentence goal]

- **Non-Goals (optional, drift-killer):**
  - [What is explicitly NOT being done]
  - [What must NOT expand]

### Target Files allowlist (hard gate)
- [path/to/file1]
- [path/to/file2]

Allowlist rule: exact paths only; use `(new)` prefix only when the DP explicitly allows new files.

- **Conditional Requirements:** If canon/governance surfaces (e.g., TASK.md) are modified, `SoP.md` MUST be included in the allowlist and updated.

- **Stop Condition (scope):** If any required change falls outside the allowlist, **STOP** and report.

- **Forbidden (unless DP explicitly overrides):**
  - No edits to `.github/`
  - No edits to `projects/` unless explicitly authorized
  - No renames/moves/deletes unless explicitly authorized

- **Worker Git Authority (non-negotiable):**
  - Workers do not create/switch branches.
  - Workers do not stage/commit/merge/push.
  - Workers only return diffs/results/receipt.

- **Precedence:** If any conflict exists, **TRUTH.md wins**. If unclear, STOP and ask.

- **Strict Stop Conditions (generic):**
  - STOP if any placeholder text remains in final outputs (`[ ... ]`, `TODO`, `TBD`, `...`).
  - STOP if required DP inputs are missing (do not guess).
  - STOP if IDs / naming constraints in the DP are inconsistent (when applicable).

---

## 3.4 Execution Plan (A-E Canon)

### 3.4.1 State
- **Context:** [Why we are doing this]
- **Drift:** [What is currently wrong]
- **Desired State:** [What “correct” looks like]

### 3.4.2 Request
**Numbered tasks (concrete, no vibes):**
1) [Do X]
2) [Do Y]
3) [If blocked, STOP and use BLOCKED shape]

**Required Content (optional; use when doc/governance changes demand exact text/format):**
- [Specify required sections/format rules/quality bar as needed]

### 3.4.3 Changelog
- **Log (human-readable, 1–6 bullets):**
  - [What changed]

### 3.4.4 Patch / Diff
- **Format:** Unified diff (preferred) or anchored snippets.

### 3.4.5 Receipt (Required)

#### Verification (MUST RUN; or report NOT RUN + reason + risk)
- `./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform` (or repo-correct equivalent when scope differs)
- If dump refiners are used, include this fallback line in the DP:
  - `Fallback: ./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform --format=chatgpt --out=auto --bundle`
- **Zero-Byte Check:** Verify dump is not empty (`test -s <path>`).
- Context lint (use repo-canonical command):
  - Prefer: `bash tools/lint/context.sh`
  - If not found and required: **STOP** and ask (do not invent a substitute)
- Truth lint (when TRUTH/canon surfaces touched; use repo-canonical command):
  - Prefer: `bash tools/lint/truth.sh`
  - If not found and required: **STOP** and ask (do not invent a substitute)

#### Skill capture (required during normal DP processing)
- Workflow: run `ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh harvest` to auto-generate a draft with provenance and semantic collision checks.
- Review: inspect the draft in `storage/handoff/` for heuristic accuracy (Hot Zone and High Churn). Refine Invocation guidance and Solution. Do not edit the Provenance block.
- Promote: run `ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh promote <draft_path>` or log "no new skill promoted" with a rationale in RESULTS.
- Legacy capture is forbidden. Do not manually write skill files; the provenance block is required.
- If a DP requires skill capture, the DP Target Files allowlist must include `docs/library/SKILLS.md`.
- Proof required in RESULTS:
  - Harvest-only: command invoked plus draft path and `ls storage/handoff/` output.
  - Promotion: command invoked plus `grep -n "Promotion Packet:" docs/library/SKILLS.md` and `grep -n "docs/library/skills/S-LEARN-" docs/library/INDEX.md`.

#### Artifact bundle (required directory)
- `storage/handoff/`

#### Proof bundle checklist (required; naming pattern over exact names)
- `storage/handoff/DP-OPS--RESULTS.md` (required)
- `storage/handoff/OPEN-PORCELAIN-[work-branch]-[hash].txt` (required)
- `storage/handoff/OPEN-[work-branch]-[hash].txt` (required)
- `storage/dumps/dump-full-...` (or platform scope as applicable)
- `git diff --name-only` (include in RESULTS)
- `git diff --stat` (include in RESULTS)
- `NEXT:` one single action (include in RESULTS)

**MANDATE:** No receipt/proof bundle = **AUTOMATIC DISAPPROVAL**.
Closeout routine receipts not being produced CONSISTENTLY INCLUDING PORCELAIN, DUMP AND OPEN is a failure condition.
Partial receipts (e.g., missing OPEN artifacts when a session was started) are considered failures.

#### REQUIRED OUTPUT
**MUST include a "Status" block at the top of RESULTS:**
- `Scope summary:` (1 sentence validating the loop)
- `Tracked change:` (What was edited)
- `Verification:` (Output of proofs)

#### RESULTS file must include (minimum)
- Verification results (RUN/NOT RUN + reason + risk)
- Patch/diff proof bundle (status/diff list or direct diff)
- Receipt pointers (OPEN + PORCELAIN + DUMP outputs/paths)
- `git diff --name-only` output
- `git diff --stat` output
- `NEXT:` one single action

**Storage artifact flow (local-only, untracked):**
- OPEN and OPEN-PORCELAIN outputs land in `storage/handoff/`.
- Dump bundles land in `storage/dumps/`.
- Results receipts land in `storage/handoff/DP-OPS-0000-RESULTS.md` (pattern).
- Operator stores DP drafts under `storage/dp/intake/` and moves or copies to `storage/dp/processed/` after completion (or when reusing a previously executed DP).
- These are retention paths only; they are not worker prerequisites unless the DP explicitly says so.

---

## 4. Closeout (Mandatory)

### Worker closeout duties (end of session)
- [ ] Produce/Update: `storage/handoff/DP-OPS-[ID]-RESULTS.md`
- [ ] If canon/governance surfaces were changed, include **SoP.md** in scope and update it in the same PR slice.
- [ ] Run `ops/bin/prune` (hygiene).
- [ ] Run `ops/bin/llms` (refresh context bundles).
- [ ] Ensure proof bundle checklist is satisfied (above). (No bundle = DISAPPROVE.)
- [ ] Fill out the Mandatory Closing Block (see below).
- [ ] Append a **TASK Work Log** entry (below) capturing:
  - what changed (high level)
  - gates/verification outcome (pass/fail or not run + reason)
  - blockers (if any)
  - **NEXT:** one single action

### Mandatory Closing Block (Varied Wording Required)
Varied Wording provision: Each entry must use meaningfully distinct wording; copy or minor tense changes are not acceptable. Entry 4 must differ from Entry 1.
1. Primary Commit Header (plaintext)
2. Pull Request Title (plaintext)
3. Pull Request Description (markdown)
4. Final Squash Stub (plaintext) (Must differ from #1)
5. Extended Technical Manifest (plaintext)
6. Review Conversation Starter (markdown)

### Integrator/operator closeout duties
- [ ] Review diff vs DP scope/forbidden zones
- [ ] Run repo-gates / required checks
- [ ] Commit/push/open PR/merge (operator-controlled)

---

## 4.1 Thread Transition (Reset / Archive Rule)
**Purpose:** Prevent TASK from becoming a museum while preserving continuity.

When a DP is **complete** (merged) or **ended** (canceled/superseded):
1) Add a final Work Log entry that starts with: `THREAD END:` and includes:
   - outcome (merged/canceled/superseded)
   - pointer to the DP RESULTS file
   - `NEXT:` the single action (often “start new DP” or “await operator”)
2) Reset sections **2. Active Context** and **3. Current Dispatch Packet** to the next DP.
3) Keep the Work Log, but separate threads with a visible divider line:
   - `---`
   - `THREAD START: DP-OPS-[NEWID]`

(If the Work Log gets too long, it’s acceptable to keep only the most recent thread’s entries here and move older thread logs into the DP RESULTS file—only when explicitly directed.)

---

## 5. Work Log (Timestamped Continuity)
**Rule:** This is not a transcript. It’s the durable breadcrumb trail.  
**Expectation:** Append a new timestamped entry on every DP closeout (no exceptions).  
**Each entry ends with:** `NEXT: <one single action>`.

- **Example format:** `2026-01-27 14:05 — DP-OPS-0005: Example entry only. Verification: NOT RUN. Blockers: none. NEXT: follow-up.`
- *[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]* — DP-OPS-[ID]: [short note]. Verification: [RUN/NOT RUN]. Blockers: [none/...]. NEXT: [single action]
- *[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]* — [short note]. Verification: [..]. Blockers: [..]. NEXT: [single action]
- *2026-01-27 14:26* — DP-OPS-0005: Hardened TASK (worker git authority + dump-as-command + Work Log expectation); synced DP lint to TASK headings; added TASK gating in .github; updated SoP. Verification: RUN (dp OK; context warnings). Blockers: none. NEXT: validate end-to-end DP flow with a small "toy DP" and ensure gates behave as intended.

## AGENTS.md
# AGENTS.md
# Pointer-first agent constitution. Do not duplicate canon text.

## 1. Staffing Protocol
- Operator (Human): Owns final decisions, approvals, and secrets. Performs all commits, pushes, and merges.
- Integrator (Lead AI): Maintains governance, structural integrity, and auditing. Generates Dispatch Packets and detects system drift.
- Contractor (Guest AI): Executes specific logic tasks and drafts implementation details within a defined scope.

## 2. Behavioral Logic Standard
- Linguistic Precision: No contractions.
- Linguistic Precision: Quantitative reporting required for deviations from protocol.
- Linguistic Precision: Absolute literalism; seek clarification for ambiguity before proceeding.
- Operational Directives: Anti-drift governance; logic or files misaligned with TRUTH.md are a system failure.
- Operational Directives: Context hygiene; ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md must exclude docs/library/agents, docs/library/tasks, and docs/library/skills.
- Operational Directives: Logic conflict resolution; stop until the Operator redefines parameters if a task violates TRUTH.md.
- Operational Directives: Equilibrium maintenance; a task is complete only when SoP.md is updated.
- Operational Directives: Reuse-first discipline; cross-reference ops/ templates before creating new artifacts.
- Operational Directives: Contractor closeout skill harvesting uses ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh harvest for provenance.
- Operational Directives: Contractor closeout skill harvesting forbids manual creation of docs/library/skills markdown files.
- Operational Directives: Contractor closeout skill harvesting is mandatory for production payloads and optional for platform maintenance.

## 3. Hard Constraints (SSOT)
- TRUTH.md
- SoP.md
- TASK.md
- ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md
- docs/library/MANUAL.md
- docs/library/MAP.md

## 4. Entry Points
- llms.txt

## 5. Drafting Proposal Protocol
- Integrator proposals: An Integrator may propose a work branch name and Base HEAD when they are not yet provided.
- Operator authority: The Operator creates branches and provides the final Base HEAD; Contractors do not create or switch branches.
- Provisional marking: Any provisional value must be prefixed with PROPOSED: during drafting and must be removed or replaced with finalized values before any worker runs a DP.
