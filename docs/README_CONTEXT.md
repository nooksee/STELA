# README_CONTEXT - Context overview

## What the context surface is
The context surface is the minimal, curated set of documents that lets a new operator or AI assistant rehydrate project reality without guessing.

## Where it lives today
- `ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT_MANIFEST.md` is the required list of canonical pointers.
- `docs/library/CONTINUITY_MAP.md` is the operator-facing pointer map.

## How to keep it current
- When docs move, update `ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT_MANIFEST.md` and `docs/library/CONTINUITY_MAP.md` to point at the new locations.
- Keep onboarding pointers aligned to `docs/10-QUICKSTART.md`.

## What it is not
- It is not runtime configuration.
- It is not a deployment artifact.
- It does not replace canon in `ops/` or the Truth-Layer docs.
