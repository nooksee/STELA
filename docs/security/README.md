# Security Operations (Manual)

## 0. Policy & Reporting (SSOT)
**The canonical security policy lives at the repo root:**
* [`../../SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md)

**Refer to the root policy for:**
* Reporting Vulnerabilities (GitHub Security Advisories).
* AI Usage & Provenance Rules.
* Secrets Management Standards.

## 1. Operational Guidelines
*(This section is reserved for specific "how-to" guides, e.g., "Key Rotation", "Audit Log Analysis". Currently, follow the standard Dispatch Packet workflow in `TASK.md` for all security remediation.)*

## 2. Jurisdiction
* **Operator:** Approves all security patches.
* **Integrator:** Scans for policy drift.
* **Contractor:** Drafts fixes but never commits secrets.
