# Upstreams

This repo uses upstream donor projects as **historical and technical inputs**.

Policy:
- Upstreams are stored under `upstream/` and treated as read-only.
- We do not "develop inside upstream".
- We import surgically into `packages/` and adapt into `src/`.

## Current upstreams
- Burzi PHP-Nuke: `upstream/php-nuke/`
- Titanium: `upstream/titanium/`
