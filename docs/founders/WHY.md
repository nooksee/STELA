# Why PHP-Nuke CE Exists

PHP-Nuke CE exists because software has memory — and most projects forget it.

PHP-Nuke proved a CMS could be understandable, community-owned, and modular without burying admins in ceremony.

Over time, the CMS space split into two failures:
- legacy systems frozen in time
- modern systems that hide responsibility behind layers

PHP-Nuke CE is a continuation edition — not a rewrite, not a museum, not a fork dump.

We preserve legacy expectations where they still serve people, and we modernize only with explicit, explainable reasons.

This is a CMS for administrators who want confidence instead of mystery, and for communities that want continuity without stagnation.

Modern software should not erase its past. And legacy software should not be trapped by it.
Modern software should not erase its past. And legacy software should not be trapped by it.

PHP-Nuke CE exists to prove both can be true.
