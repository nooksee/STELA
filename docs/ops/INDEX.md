# Docs / ops - pointer index

Short index for operators. Ops canon lives in `ops/`; this index points to it.
If a doc is not linked here or captured in `docs/triage/INBOX.md`, it is drift.

## Docs library + help (curated surface)
Use `./ops/bin/help` as the operator front door for curated docs.
- `./ops/bin/help` shows the command menu and quick start.
- `./ops/bin/help <term>` searches `docs/` (grep with line numbers).

Library location:
- Root: `docs/library/`
- Index: `docs/library/LIBRARY_INDEX.md` (curated topic list)

Add a new library entry:
- Update `docs/library/LIBRARY_INDEX.md` with a new line; keep it curated (not every .md).

Operator Manual:
- `docs/library/OPERATOR_MANUAL.md`
