# Repo Nomenclature & Structure

Directory naming:
- lowercase folders: `src/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `upstream/`
- use underscores only when needed (legacy compatibility): `public_html/`

Rules:
- `public_html/` is deploy root
- `src/` is the product
- `upstream/` is read-only donor snapshots
- `packages/` is the import/adaptation staging area
