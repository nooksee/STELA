### Refresh + Draft DP (Architect Stance)
**Use when:** Creating a new Dispatch Packet. Enforces `TASK.md` structure and prevents hallucinated requirements.
**Attach:** `OPEN` + `dump` + `plan.md`.

SEE ATTACHED: OPEN + repo dump. Refresh state.
DRAFT <DP-ID> from the attached <summary-file>.
- Use the dump branch + freshness (Base HEAD) exactly as shown in the dump/OPEN.
- Strictly use the headings + order in TASK.md (including closing headings).
- Output ONLY the DP.
- Do not add/rename sections.
- If required inputs are missing, STOP and ask only for the missing items.
