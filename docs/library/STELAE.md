# Stelae

Stelae are short operator-facing reminders to keep conversations precise and calm.
They are not policy; they are practical nudges that reduce ambiguity.
Use them to keep talk-only and execution distinct and predictable.

## Spelling Policy
- "Stela" is the singular project / platform name.
- "Stelae" is the plural / collection label.
Examples:
- Correct: "Stela is the platform name."
- Correct: "These Stelae keep operator guidance consistent."

## How to use
- Drop `DISCUSS-ONLY` at the top when you want discussion without action.
- Remove `DISCUSS-ONLY` and issue a DP when you want execution.
- Keep entries short, concrete, and easy to apply in the next message.

## Format
Use string IDs only; no registry or tooling.

Example:
`S-ATTN-01 — short, practical reminder.`
