# Continuity Map (Operator Surface)

Pointer-only map of the canonical continuity surfaces that preserve state across stateless runs.

## Map (files + purpose)
- Constitution: `PROJECT_TRUTH.md` (canon rules and definitions)
- State ledger: `STATE_OF_PLAY.md` (what shipped, when, and why)
- Curated library manifest + front door: `docs/library/LIBRARY_INDEX.md`, `ops/bin/help` (approved operator surface)
- Operator manual: `docs/library/OPERATOR_MANUAL.md` (how to run the system)
- Dispatch Packet protocol + template: `ops/init/protocols/DISPATCH_PACKET_PROTOCOL.md`, `ops/templates/DISPATCH_PACKET_TEMPLATE.md` (work-order governance)
- Context + launch packs (ICL): `ops/init/icl/launch_pack/CONTEXT_PACK.md`, `ops/init/icl/launch_pack/AI_CONTEXT_SYNC.md`, `ops/init/icl/context_pack.json`
- Project map + canonical tree: `PROJECT_MAP.md`, `CANONICAL_TREE.md` (structure + boundaries)
- Docs index: `docs/00-INDEX.md` (docs navigation)
- Snapshot tool: `ops/bin/snapshot` (state capture)

## Later bucket (ideas only; no implementation)
- Location: `STATE_OF_PLAY.md` (section: "Later bucket")
- Use: dedupe / clone detection ideas only; record, do not implement.
