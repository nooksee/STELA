# Continuity Map (Operator Surface)

Pointer-only map of the canonical continuity surfaces that preserve state and governance across stateless runs.

## 1. Governance & Logic (The Constitution)
- **Constitution**: `TRUTH.md` — Invariants, filing doctrine, and the canonical project map.
- **Agent Jurisdiction**: `AGENTS.md` — Behavioral logic standards and staffing protocols for Operator, Integrator, and Contractor.
- **Discovery**: `llms.txt` — Primary entry point for AI workers to discover the truth layer.

## 2. State Ledger (The Record)
- **History**: `SoP.md` — The "State of Play" ledger; records what was shipped, when, and why.
- **Active Thread**: `TASK.md` — Single living surface for current work; includes the Dispatch Packet (DP) and work log.

## 3. Wayfinding (The Manuals)
- **Operator Entry**: `docs/library/OPERATOR_MANUAL.md` — Primary mechanics and command cheat sheet.
- **Curated Library**: `docs/library/LIBRARY_INDEX.md` — Curated index of approved operator surfaces.
- **Project Index**: `docs/INDEX.md` — The general documentation front door.

## 4. State Capture & Ingestion (The Tools)
- **Prompt Generation**: `ops/bin/open` — Generates the OPEN prompt with freshness gate and git state.
- **State Capture**: `ops/bin/dump` — Captures repository state for agent ingestion.
- **Context Validation**: `ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT_MANIFEST.md` — Canonical list of required context artifacts.
