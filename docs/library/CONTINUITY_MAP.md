# Continuity Map (Operator Surface)

Pointer-only map of the canonical continuity surfaces that preserve state across stateless runs.

## Map (files + purpose)
- Constitution: `TRUTH.md` (canon rules and definitions)
- State ledger: `SoP.md` (what shipped, when, and why)
- Curated library manifest + front door: `docs/library/LIBRARY_INDEX.md`, `ops/bin/help` (approved operator surface)
- Operator manual: `docs/library/OPERATOR_MANUAL.md` (how to run the system)
- Project map + canonical tree: `TRUTH.md Section 3`, `TRUTH.md Section 4` (structure + boundaries)
- Docs index: `docs/00-INDEX.md` (docs navigation)
- Dump tool: `ops/bin/dump` (state capture)

## Later bucket (ideas only; no implementation)
- Location: `SoP.md` (section: "Later bucket")
- Use: dedupe / clone detection ideas only; record, do not implement.
