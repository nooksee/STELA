# STELA Naming (Seed)

STELA is the platform name for the repo-resident operating system; it is a stone tablet metaphor for published canon and governance visible to all. This is a naming seed only and does not authorize renames or refactors.

Allowed usage:
- Use STELA in doctrine text when referring to the platform name.
- Keep legacy `nukeCE` strings unless a DP explicitly authorizes changes.

Forbidden usage:
- No repo, directory, or package renames.
- No mass replacement of legacy strings.
- No new brand token variants.

SSOT: `PROJECT_TRUTH.md`.
