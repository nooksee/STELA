# projects/

This directory holds project payloads.

- Registered projects are tracked in `docs/library/datasets/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`.
- Use `./ops/bin/project init <name> --dry-run` to preview creation.
- Use `./ops/bin/project init <name> --confirm` to create a minimal README-first scaffold.
- Do not edit project payloads unless a DP explicitly includes them.
