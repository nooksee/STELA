## PoT.md
# Policy of Truth (PoT)

## Preamble: Doctrine
The system prevents action that violates policy. It does not request compliance.
PoT is the single constitutional document for Stela governance.

## 1. Physical Laws

### 1.1 Filing Doctrine
Filing:
- `ops/` = Run (binaries, manifests, automation).
- `docs/` = Explain (manuals and rationale).
- `projects/` = Work (payload code).
- `storage/` = Trash (local artifacts, never canon).

### 1.2 Axioms
- Precedence: PoT is final authority; if conflict exists, stop and ask.
- SSOT: one canonical file per domain; other mentions are pointers.
- Reuse-first: search `ops/` for an existing template before creating a new artifact.
- Context Hazard: any inclusion of `docs/library/agents`, `docs/library/tasks`, or `docs/library/skills` in the global context manifest is a failure.
- Drift: any divergence between canon and repository state, or duplication of canon outside SSOT, is a failure state that requires stop and correction.
- SoP: history ledger only; no permanent rules live there.

### 1.3 Canon Surfaces
- `PoT.md` — constitution, staffing, jurisdiction, and enforcement (SSOT).
- `TASK.md` — active work surface and DP contract.
- `SoP.md` — history ledger and shipment record.
- `docs/MANUAL.md` — operator mechanics.
- `docs/MAP.md` — context wayfinding.
- `ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md` — required context set.
- `llms.txt` — discovery entry point.

## 2. Enforcement
Integrator plus Automation (linters, repo-gates, and binaries).
Mandate:
- Stop work.
- Reject PRs.
- Kill processes.
Triggers:
- Any PoT violation or canon drift.
- Context hazard in the global manifest.
- Scope breach or forbidden zone access.

## 3. Jurisdiction
Scope: `ops/`, `docs/`, `projects/`, `tools/`, `.github/`, and root governance surfaces.
Law: PoT is the sole authority across all scopes. No parallel jurisdictions exist.

## 4. Staffing & Logic

### 4.1 Staffing Protocol
- Operator (Human): Owns final decisions, approvals, and secrets. Performs all commits, pushes, and merges.
- Integrator (Lead AI): Maintains governance, structural integrity, and auditing. Generates Dispatch Packets and detects system drift.
- Contractor (Guest AI): Executes specific logic tasks and drafts implementation details within a defined scope.

### 4.2 Behavioral Logic Standard
- Linguistic Precision: No contractions across any scope, including projects.
- Linguistic Precision: Quantitative reporting required for deviations from protocol.
- Linguistic Precision: Absolute literalism; seek clarification for ambiguity before proceeding.
- Operational Directives: Anti-drift governance; logic or files misaligned with PoT.md are a system failure.
- Operational Directives: Context hygiene; ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md must exclude docs/library/agents, docs/library/tasks, and docs/library/skills.
- Operational Directives: Logic conflict resolution; stop until the Operator redefines parameters if a task violates PoT.md.
- Operational Directives: Equilibrium maintenance; a task is complete only when SoP.md is updated.
- Operational Directives: Reuse-first discipline; cross-reference ops/ templates before creating new artifacts.
- Operational Directives: Contractor closeout skill harvesting uses ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh harvest for provenance.
- Operational Directives: Contractor closeout skill harvesting forbids manual creation of docs/library/skills markdown files.
- Operational Directives: Contractor closeout skill harvesting is mandatory for production payloads and optional for platform maintenance.

### 4.3 Hard Constraints (SSOT)
- PoT.md
- SoP.md
- TASK.md
- ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md
- docs/MANUAL.md
- docs/MAP.md

### 4.4 Entry Points
- llms.txt

### 4.5 Drafting Proposal Protocol
- Integrator proposals: An Integrator may propose a work branch name and Base HEAD when they are not yet provided.
- Operator authority: The Operator creates branches and provides the final Base HEAD; Contractors do not create or switch branches.
- Provisional marking: Any provisional value must be prefixed with PROPOSED: during drafting and must be removed or replaced with finalized values before any worker runs a DP.

## 5. Workflow & Security

### 5.1 Non-Negotiables
- Do not push to `main`.
- Work only on `work/*` branches.
- Every PR must pass repo-gates.

### 5.2 Standard Workflow
- Create a branch named `work/<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Make small, reviewable changes.
- Keep unrelated refactors out of the change set.
- Review changes visually before commit.
- Use clear commit messages.
- Push the `work/*` branch, open a PR, wait for repo-gates, then merge.

### 5.3 Provenance
- Record imported or adapted external code in `docs/UPSTREAMS.md` or the correct truth-layer document.
- Include source, purpose, changes, and known risks or limits.

### 5.4 Security Policy
Roles and access expectations are defined in PoT.md.

#### Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to the repo.
- Use environment variables or a local secrets manager for sensitive values.
- If a secret is exposed, rotate it and document the remediation.

#### AI Usage Policy
- AI assistance is allowed with human oversight.
- All AI-proposed changes must be reviewed by a human operator.
- Provide citations or provenance for external sources or non-trivial claims.

#### Reporting Vulnerabilities
Preferred:
- Use a GitHub Security Advisory for this repository.

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories:
- Contact the repository owners via GitHub and request a private channel.
- Do not disclose details publicly until coordinated.

When reporting, include:
- A clear description of the issue.
- Minimal reproduction steps or proof-of-concept.
- Affected files or versions (if known).
- Suggested mitigations (optional, appreciated).

#### Handling and Disclosure
- Reports are acknowledged as soon as practical.
- Fixes are prioritized by impact, exploitability, and clarity.
- We aim for coordinated, responsible disclosure.

#### Known Issues and Future Improvements


## SoP.md
Archive policy: keep most recent 30 entries; older entries moved to `storage/archives/root/SoP-archive-YYYY-MM.md`.

## TASK.md
# STELA TASK DASHBOARD (LIVING SURFACE)
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Owner (Integrator):** Not provided  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07

> This file is the **single living surface** for the current work thread:
> - **Top:** current Dispatch Packet (DP) intent + constraints
> - **Bottom:** Work Log (timestamped continuity breadcrumbs + single next action)

Canon surface definitions live in `PoT.md`.

---

## 1. Required Context Load (Pre-Flight)
**Rule:** No execution until the worker explicitly confirms these are loaded.

**Must read (always):**
- [ ] `PoT.md` (constitution + jurisdiction)
- [ ] `SoP.md` (merge-grade readiness ledger)
- [ ] `ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md` (required context set)
- [ ] `docs/MAP.md` (continuity terrain)

(OPEN is for Integrator/DP Writer state refresh; Worker does not read OPEN).
DISPOSABLE ARTIFACTS (chat logs, etc.) MUST NOT BE REFERENCED OR INCLUDED.

**Job-specific canon (fill in per DP):**
- [ ] `tools/verify.sh`
- [ ] `ops/bin/llms`
- [ ] `ops/bin/prune`

**Loading discipline (worker must echo):**
- “Loaded: PoT, SoP, CONTEXT, MAP (+ job-specific files).”

---

## 2. Active Context (Thread Header)
- **Goal** : Establish the agent promotion ledger, immunological agent linter, and promotion logging integration.
- **Current DP** : DP-OPS-0034 — Agent System Hardening (Immune System)
- **Work Branch (Integrator-assigned OR Integrator-proposed (Operator-created))**: work/agent-hardening-0034
- **Base HEAD (operator-provided)**: cfbde022d
- **Single Next Action**: Operator review DP-OPS-0034 results and merge.
- **Blockers**: None

**Drafting note:** Provisional Work Branch and Base HEAD values are allowed during drafting but must be finalized before worker execution. Workers still stop on any freshness mismatch and do not create or switch branches.

---

## 3. Current Dispatch Packet (DP) - Stela Standard (A-E)
**Formatting rule:** When emitted in chat, the entire DP must be enclosed in a single fenced code block (start to end).
# DP-OPS-0000: Example Title (replace with the real DP id and title before worker execution)

<!-- DP SCOPE BEGIN -->

## 3.1 Freshness Gate (Must Pass Before Work)
Base Branch: use the operator-provided base branch name  
Required Work Branch: use the operator-provided work branch (must already exist)  
Base HEAD: use the operator-provided short hash; if drafting, write `Not provided` or `Current (draft; lock at merge)`

Required local re-check (worker runs; paste results in RESULTS):
- `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
- `git rev-parse HEAD`
- `git status --porcelain`

Worker must already be on the **Required Work Branch** listed above (no branch creation or switching).

STOP if any mismatch.  
STOP if the Required Work Branch is missing.  
STOP if told to create or switch branches.

---

## 3.2 Required Context Load (Read Before Doing Anything)
**Worker must confirm loaded before acting:**
- PoT, SoP, CONTEXT, MAP
- Plus any DP-scoped files listed here:
  - Exact path to each DP-scoped file
  - Additional exact path if needed

(OPEN is for Integrator/DP Writer state refresh; Worker does not read OPEN).
DISPOSABLE ARTIFACTS (chat logs, etc.) MUST NOT BE REFERENCED OR INCLUDED.

---

## 3.3 Scope and Safety
- **Objective:** One sentence goal describing the intended outcome.

- **Non-Goals (optional, drift-killer):**
  - What is explicitly not being done.
  - What must not expand.

### Target Files allowlist (hard gate)
- Exact path to each allowed file.
- Exact path to any additional allowed file.

Allowlist rule: exact paths only; use `(new)` prefix only when the DP explicitly allows new files.

- **Conditional Requirements:** If canon/governance surfaces (e.g., TASK.md) are modified, `SoP.md` MUST be included in the allowlist and updated.

- **Stop Condition (scope):** If any required change falls outside the allowlist, **STOP** and report.

- **Forbidden (unless DP explicitly overrides):**
  - No edits to `.github/`
  - No edits to `projects/` unless explicitly authorized
  - No renames/moves/deletes unless explicitly authorized

- **Worker Git Authority (non-negotiable):**
  - Workers do not create/switch branches.
  - Workers do not stage/commit/merge/push.
  - Workers only return diffs/results/receipt.

- **Precedence:** If any conflict exists, **PoT.md wins**. If unclear, STOP and ask.

- **Strict Stop Conditions (generic):**
  - STOP if any placeholder text remains in final outputs (square-bracket tokens, to-do markers, to-be-determined markers, or standalone ellipses).
  - STOP if required DP inputs are missing (do not guess).
  - STOP if IDs / naming constraints in the DP are inconsistent (when applicable).

---

## 3.4 Execution Plan (A-E Canon)

### 3.4.1 State
- **Context:** Why we are doing this.
- **Drift:** What is currently wrong.
- **Desired State:** What correct looks like.

### 3.4.2 Request
**Numbered tasks (concrete, no vibes):**
1) Do the first concrete task.
2) Do the next concrete task.
3) If blocked, STOP and use BLOCKED shape.

**Required Content (optional; use when doc/governance changes demand exact text/format):**
- Specify required sections, format rules, or quality bar as needed.

### 3.4.3 Changelog
- **Log (human-readable, 1–6 bullets):**
  - Summarize what changed.

### 3.4.4 Patch / Diff
- **Format:** Unified diff (preferred) or anchored snippets.

### 3.4.5 Receipt (Required)

#### Verification (MUST RUN; or report NOT RUN + reason + risk)
- `./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform` (or repo-correct equivalent when scope differs)
- If dump refiners are used, include this fallback line in the DP:
  - `Fallback: ./ops/bin/dump --scope=platform --format=chatgpt --out=auto --bundle`
- **Zero-Byte Check:** Verify dump is not empty (`test -s <path>`).
- Context lint (use repo-canonical command):
  - Prefer: `bash tools/lint/context.sh`
  - If not found and required: **STOP** and ask (do not invent a substitute)
- Truth lint (when PoT or canon surfaces touched; use repo-canonical command):
  - Prefer: `bash tools/lint/truth.sh`
  - If not found and required: **STOP** and ask (do not invent a substitute)

#### Skill capture (required during normal DP processing)
- Workflow: run `ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh harvest` to auto-generate a draft with provenance and semantic collision checks.
- Review: inspect the draft in `storage/handoff/` for heuristic accuracy (Hot Zone and High Churn). Refine Invocation guidance and Solution. Do not edit the Provenance block.
- Promote: run `ops/lib/scripts/skill.sh promote <draft_path>` or log "no new skill promoted" with a rationale in RESULTS.
- Legacy capture is forbidden. Do not manually write skill files; the provenance block is required.
- If a DP requires skill capture, the DP Target Files allowlist must include `docs/library/SKILLS.md`.
- Proof required in RESULTS:
  - Harvest-only: command invoked plus draft path and `ls storage/handoff/` output.
  - Promotion: command invoked plus `grep -n "Promotion Packet:" docs/library/SKILLS.md` and `grep -n "docs/library/skills/S-LEARN-" docs/library/INDEX.md`.

#### Artifact bundle (required directory)
- `storage/handoff/`

#### Proof bundle checklist (required; naming pattern over exact names)
- `storage/handoff/DP-OPS-0000-RESULTS.md` (use actual DP id)
- `storage/handoff/OPEN-PORCELAIN-work-branch-hash.txt` (use actual work branch and short hash)
- `storage/handoff/OPEN-work-branch-hash.txt` (use actual work branch and short hash)
- `storage/dumps/dump-full-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.txt` (use actual dump filename)
- `git diff --name-only` (include in RESULTS)
- `git diff --stat` (include in RESULTS)
- `NEXT:` one single action (include in RESULTS)

**MANDATE:** No receipt/proof bundle = **AUTOMATIC DISAPPROVAL**.
Closeout routine receipts not being produced CONSISTENTLY INCLUDING PORCELAIN, DUMP AND OPEN is a failure condition.
Partial receipts (e.g., missing OPEN artifacts when a session was started) are considered failures.

#### REQUIRED OUTPUT
**MUST include a "Status" block at the top of RESULTS:**
- `Scope summary:` (1 sentence validating the loop)
- `Tracked change:` (What was edited)
- `Verification:` (Output of proofs)

#### RESULTS file must include (minimum)
- Verification results (RUN/NOT RUN + reason + risk)
- Patch/diff proof bundle (status/diff list or direct diff)
- Receipt pointers (OPEN + PORCELAIN + DUMP outputs/paths)
- `git diff --name-only` output
- `git diff --stat` output
- `NEXT:` one single action

**Storage artifact flow (local-only, untracked):**
- OPEN and OPEN-PORCELAIN outputs land in `storage/handoff/`.
- Dump bundles land in `storage/dumps/dump-full-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.txt` (example; use actual dump filename).
- Results receipts land in `storage/handoff/DP-OPS-0000-RESULTS.md` (example; use actual DP id).
- Operator stores DP drafts under `storage/dp/intake/` and moves or copies to `storage/dp/processed/` after completion (or when reusing a previously executed DP).
- These are retention paths only; they are not worker prerequisites unless the DP explicitly says so.

---

## 4. Closeout (Mandatory)

### Worker closeout duties (end of session)
- Produce or update: `storage/handoff/DP-OPS-0000-RESULTS.md` (use actual DP id).
- If canon/governance surfaces were changed, include **SoP.md** in scope and update it in the same PR slice.
- Run `ops/bin/prune` (hygiene).
- Run `ops/bin/llms` (refresh context bundles).
- Ensure proof bundle checklist is satisfied (above). (No bundle = DISAPPROVE.)
- Fill out the Mandatory Closing Block (see below).
- Append a **TASK Work Log** entry (below) capturing:
  - what changed (high level)
  - gates/verification outcome (pass/fail or not run + reason)
  - blockers (if any)
  - **NEXT:** one single action

### Mandatory Closing Block (Varied Wording Required)
Varied Wording provision: Each entry must use meaningfully distinct wording; copy or minor tense changes are not acceptable. Entry 4 must differ from Entry 1.
1. Primary Commit Header (plaintext)
2. Pull Request Title (plaintext)
3. Pull Request Description (markdown)
4. Final Squash Stub (plaintext) (Must differ from #1)
5. Extended Technical Manifest (plaintext)
6. Review Conversation Starter (markdown)

### Integrator/operator closeout duties
- Review diff vs DP scope/forbidden zones.
- Run repo-gates / required checks.
- Commit/push/open PR/merge (operator-controlled).

---

## 4.1 Thread Transition (Reset / Archive Rule)
**Purpose:** Prevent TASK from becoming a museum while preserving continuity.

When a DP is **complete** (merged) or **ended** (canceled/superseded):
1) Add a final Work Log entry that starts with: `THREAD END:` and includes:
   - outcome (merged/canceled/superseded)
   - pointer to the DP RESULTS file
   - `NEXT:` the single action (often “start new DP” or “await operator”)
2) Reset sections **2. Active Context** and **3. Current Dispatch Packet** to the next DP.
3) Keep the Work Log, but separate threads with a visible divider line:
   - `---`
   - `THREAD START: DP-OPS-0000` (use the actual next DP id)

(If the Work Log gets too long, it’s acceptable to keep only the most recent thread’s entries here and move older thread logs into the DP RESULTS file—only when explicitly directed.)

---

## 5. Work Log (Timestamped Continuity)
> **NOTICE:** This log is for the *active* DP only. Historical logs are archived in 'storage/archives/'. Do not rely on this log for long-term history.

**Rule:** This is not a transcript. It is the durable breadcrumb trail.  
**Expectation:** Append a new timestamped entry on every DP closeout (no exceptions).  
**Each entry ends with:** `NEXT: <one single action>`.

~~~

---

## 2. Dispatch Packet (DP) Mechanics
**Placement:**
* Drafts: `storage/dp/intake/`
* Processed: `storage/dp/processed/`

**Disapproval Triggers (When to Reject):**
* ❌ Missing `RECEIPT` (Proof Bundle).
* ❌ Verification steps reported as "NOT RUN".
* ❌ `git diff --stat` does not match the claims.
* ❌ Forbidden scope touched (Drift).

---

## 3. Scope Definition
* **Platform:** `ops/`, `docs/`, `tools/`, `.github/`. (OS).
* **Project:** `projects/`. (Payload).
* **Rule:** Default to `--scope=platform` unless the DP explicitly targets a project.

---

## 4. Key Paths (Reference)
* **Constitution:** [`../../PoT.md`](../../PoT.md)
* **Active Contract:** [`../../TASK.md`](../../TASK.md)
* **History:** [`../../SoP.md`](../../SoP.md)
* **Artifacts:** `storage/handoff/` (Results), `storage/dumps/` (State).
* **Archives:** `storage/archives/` (Museum).


## docs/MAP.md
# Continuity Map (State Persistence)

## 0. Philosophy
**The repo is stateless; the Map provides the memory.**
This document defines the specific surfaces that must be loaded to preserve governance, history, and active intent across sessions.

## 1. The Constitution (Immutable Law)
*Rules that do not change without a governance event.*
* **Policy of Truth:** [`../../PoT.md`](../../PoT.md) — Constitution, staffing, jurisdiction, and enforcement (SSOT).
* **Discovery:** [`../../llms.txt`](../../llms.txt) — The machine-readable entry point.

## 2. The Ledger (Mutable State)
*Living records of what has happened and what is happening.*
* **History:** [`../../SoP.md`](../../SoP.md) — The State of Play. (What shipped, when, why).
* **Active Contract:** [`../../TASK.md`](../../TASK.md) — The Dispatch Packet. (Current objective and work log).

## 3. The Interface (Wayfinding)
*Operator-facing manuals for navigation.*
* **Command Console:** [`MANUAL.md`](MANUAL.md) — Mechanics and top commands.
* **Curated Index:** [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md) — The approved library of operator guidance.

## 4. The Bridge (Ingestion Tools)
*Mechanisms that move state from disk to context.*
* **Generation:** [`../../ops/bin/open`](../../ops/bin/open) — Creates the session prompt.
* **Capture:** [`../../ops/bin/dump`](../../ops/bin/dump) — Serializes the platform.
* **Validation:** [`../../ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md`](../../ops/lib/manifests/CONTEXT.md) — The required context checklist.

## 5. Unified Jurisdiction
*Policy of Truth governs all scopes without parallel authority.*
* **Single Authority:** PoT is the sole authority across `ops/`, `docs/`, and `projects/`.
* **Project Position:** Projects are payloads operating under PoT, not a separate provider or consumer tier.

# Governance (Coherence & Drift Control)

## 0. Philosophy
**Governance is not “process theater” — it is the product.**
This project is built to resist entropy. We value structure over memory and explicit contracts over implicit knowledge.

## 1. Non-Negotiables (Hard Rules)
* **No Direct Pushes:** `main` is read-only. Work happens on `work/*` branches → PRs → Merge.
* **Green Gates Only:** If `repo-gates` fail, the code is wrong, not the gate.
* **Canon Supremacy:** When in doubt, `PoT.md` wins.

## 2. Canon Surfaces (Source of Truth)
These files represent the immutable reality of the project.
* `PoT.md` — Constitution, staffing, jurisdiction, and logic standards.
* `SoP.md` — The historical ledger (State of Play).
* `TASK.md` — The active contract (DP) and work log.
* `docs/INDEX.md` — The system root.

## 3. Change Management (The SoP Rule)
**Rule:** You must write to `SoP.md` if (and only if) you alter **Canon** or **Governance** surfaces.
* **Why:** We track changes to the *rules* of the system, not just the code.
* **Routine Work:** Standard feature work in `projects/` does not require SoP entries unless it changes the platform itself.

## 4. Staffing Protocol (Jurisdiction)
Defined strictly in `PoT.md`:
* **Operator (Human):** Final authority. Owns approvals, commits, and secrets.
* **Integrator (AI Lead):** Guardian of governance. Detects drift and maintains structure.
* **Contractor (AI Guest):** Execution arm. Drafts logic but never commits.

## 5. AI Engagement Protocol
* **Logic First:** All agents must adhere to the Behavioral Logic Standards in `PoT.md`.
* **DP Required:** No logic changes shall be proposed without an active Dispatch Packet (DP) in `TASK.md`.
* **No Hallucinations:** Cite sources. Do not invent paths.

## 6. Tone Lanes
* **Ops Lane (`ops/`, `docs/ops/`):** Checklist-heavy, precise, dry, no-fluff.
* **Public Lane (`README.md`):** Human-centric, explanatory, welcoming.
